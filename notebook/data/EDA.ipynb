    "\n",
    "This project focuses on classifying eight distinct hand gestures using time series data from a three-axis accelerometer. The dataset includes over 4,000 samples collected from eight users, capturing variations in gesture patterns. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that accurately recognizes these gestures, enabling gesture-based interactions for improved human-computer interaction (HCI) and intuitive device control.\n"
